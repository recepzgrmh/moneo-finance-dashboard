## 🤖 The AI Experiment

> **Disclaimer:** This project is a collaborative experiment between Human and AI.

While the **architecture, file structure, tech stack, and core application logic** were fully designed and directed by the human creator, the **implementation details, code generation, CSS styling, and even this README file** were executed by Artificial Intelligence.

The goal of this project was to run a real-world experiment: **to explore how far AI-assisted development can go when guided by a clear human vision, even within a language or framework not fully mastered by the creator.**

Moneo stands as a proof of concept for the future of software development:
**Human vision. AI execution.**

## 🤖 The AI Experiment

> **Disclaimer:** This entire project—including all code, design decisions, CSS styling, and even this README—was generated by Artificial Intelligence.

The purpose of this project was to conduct a comprehensive experiment: **To see how far AI-assisted coding could go in building a complex, full-stack application in a language and framework completely unknown to the creator.** 

Moneo serves as a proof of concept for the future of software development, where AI acts not just as a helper, but as a core architect and builder.
